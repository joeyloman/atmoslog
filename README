DESCRIPTION
===========

Atmoslog (Atmospheric data logger) is a temperature/humidity logger
for TEMPerHUM devices.

This program/driver applies to TEMPerHUM USB thermometer devices
with vendor code "0c45" and product code "7402".

The code is written for Linux.

The difference between this program and others is that it uses
libusb 1.0 which is more stable then libusb 0.1.


BUILD and INSTALL
=================

Prerequirements
---------------

Install the libusb 1.x and devel packages:

- Debian/Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev

- Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
$ sudo yum install -y libusb1 libusb1-devel

Compile
-------
$ make

Install
-------
$ sudo make install
(binary will be copied to /usr/bin


GETTING STARTED
===============

usage: atmoslog <options>

options:

  -d              -> daemonize (send program to the background)
  -h              -> help/show options
  -i <interval>   -> log interval (default: 30 sec)
  -l <logfile>    -> log to file
  -o <offset>     -> offset (calibration adjustment)
  -v              -> enable verbose/debug logging

For example:

$ sudo /usr/bin/atmoslog -d -i 20 -l /var/lib/atmoslog/atmoslog_data -o -2.73

runs atmoslog in the background with a data refresh interval of 20 seconds,
a calibration offset of 2.73 degrees less (-2.73) and writes it's data to the
file "/var/lib/atmoslog/atmoslog_data" (not append!). This option can be used
with rrdtool to generate some nice graphs.

If you want to capture all data in a file (for spreadsheet imports)
you can use atmoslog as follows:
$ sudo /usr/bin/atmoslog > <filename>

note: this program needs to run as root to claim the usb device.
